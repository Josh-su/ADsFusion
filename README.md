# ADsFusion
 
the principle of this application is to be able to manage two groups of users coming from two different AD (Active Directory) in the same place and we can also select a value which changes between the servers which defines which parameter is unique is that if a user of AD 1 and a user of AD 2 have the same parameter, this means that it is the same person so for ease of management, we merge them (show the information of the 2 ADs side by side)
